        "Peter I. Frazier arXiv:1807.02811v1\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quanti es the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function de ned from this surrogate to decide where to sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a class of machine-learning-based optimization methods focused on solving the problem\n",
        "$$max_{x \\subseteq A} f(x)$$\n",
        "where the feasible set and objective function typically have the following properties\n",
        "\n",
        "- The input x is in $R^d$ for a value of d that is not too large. Typically d 20 in most successful applications of BayesOpt.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The feasible set A is a simple set, in which it is easy to assess membership. Typically A is a hyper-rectangle {$x \\subseteq R^d$ : $a_i \\le x_i \\le b_i$} or the d-dimensional simplex {$x \\subseteq R_d$ : $Σ_{x_i} = 1$} . Later (Section 5) we will relax this assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The objective function f is continuous. This will typically be required to model f using Gaussian process regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "- f is expensive to evaluate in the sense that the number of evaluations that may be performed is limited, typically to a few hundred. This limitation typically arises because each evaluation takes a substantial amount of time (typically hours), but may also occur because each evaluation bears a monetary cost (e.g., from purchasing cloud computing power, or buying laboratory materials), or an opportunity cost (e.g., if evaluating f requires asking a human subject questions who will tolerate only a limited number).\n",
        "\n",
        "- f lacks known special structure like concavity or linearity that would make it easy to optimize using techniques that leverage such structure to improve e ciency. We summarize this by saying f is a black box.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When we evaluate f, we observe only f(x) and no rst- or second-order derivatives. This prevents the application of rst- and second-order methods like gradient descent, Newtons method, or quasiNewton methods. We refer to problems with this property as derivative-free .\n",
        "\n",
        "- Our focus is on nding a global rather than local optimum."
